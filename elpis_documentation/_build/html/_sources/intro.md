# Elpis Project Documentation

Welcome to the Elpis Project documentation. This document serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for the development, maintenance, and future enhancements of the Elpis auto-trading pipeline.

Elpis is designed to provide a robust, modular, and scalable framework for algorithmic trading, enabling seamless integration of multiple trading strategies, timeframes, and financial instruments. This documentation captures all key decisions, processes, and technical details to ensure continuity, reproducibility, and efficient knowledge transfer.

## Project Objectives

The Elpis Project is driven by the following core goals:

- **Develop and maintain a complete pipeline for backtesting trading strategies**  
  Create a reliable environment to test and validate trading strategies against historical market data with rigorous metrics.

- **Build an automated trading system**  
  Implement a live trading engine capable of executing orders autonomously across multiple instruments and time horizons.

- **Comprehensive documentation**  
  Record all relevant information—design choices, challenges, solutions, and best practices—to support ongoing development and future scaling.

## Workflow Overview

The project workflow is structured progressively to ensure a solid foundation before moving into complex stages:

1. **Environment Setup**  
   Initialize the full development environment using Conda to manage dependencies and maintain reproducibility across systems.

2. **Database Configuration**  
   Deploy and configure the core data storage system using PostgreSQL enhanced with TimescaleDB, optimized for handling large volumes of time-series market data.

3. **Feature Engineering & Indicator Calculation**  
   Implement Python-based modules for efficient calculation of technical indicators, feature extraction, and data preprocessing, leveraging GPU acceleration where applicable.

4. **Backtesting & Modeling**  
   Build modular backtesting frameworks and integrate machine learning models to evaluate strategy performance and robustness.

5. **Automated Trading Execution**  
   Develop a real-time trading engine for live order management, risk controls, and portfolio optimization.

6. **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**  
   Utilize R selectively for specialized statistical analyses and visualizations that complement the Python workflow.

## Technology Stack

The Elpis Project employs a multi-language, multi-tool technology stack selected to balance performance, flexibility, and ease of maintenance:

- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**  
  The backbone for scalable, high-performance storage of large-scale market data and time-series datasets. TimescaleDB enhances PostgreSQL with efficient time-series optimizations and compression.

- **Python**  
  The primary language for core logic including indicator calculations, data processing, backtesting, machine learning, and GPU-accelerated computations. Python’s rich ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.) makes it ideal for fast prototyping and deployment.

- **R**  
  Used for specialized statistical analyses, advanced visualizations, and niche workflows where R’s extensive statistical libraries offer added value. Usage is deliberately limited due to R’s lesser support for multithreading and GPU acceleration.

## Additional Notes & Best Practices

- **Modularity & Extensibility**  
  The pipeline is designed with modular components, allowing independent development and testing of strategies, data ingestion, feature engineering, and execution layers.

- **Version Control & Collaboration**  
  All code and documentation are maintained in a version-controlled repository with clear branching strategies to support experimentation without compromising the stable core.

- **Testing & Validation**  
  Emphasis on rigorous unit tests, integration tests, and validation against benchmark datasets to ensure reliability and reproducibility of results.

- **Performance Monitoring**  
  Real-time logging, performance metrics, and anomaly detection are integral parts of the live trading system to quickly identify and respond to potential issues.

- **Security & Risk Management**  
  Risk controls including position sizing, stop-loss enforcement, and maximum drawdown thresholds are implemented to safeguard capital during live trading.
