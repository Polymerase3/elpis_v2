# Managing Your Conda Environment

Using a Conda environment is essential for any project that requires consistent and reproducible software dependencies. It ensures your project runs with the exact package versions and settings you specify, avoiding the infamous ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù dilemma. Proper environment management is especially critical for scaling, deploying on servers, or using containers like Docker.

---

#  Step 1: Creating a Project Folder and Conda Environment

Begin by setting up a dedicated directory for your project and initializing a new Conda environment:

```bash
mkdir ~/elpis2
cd ~/elpis2
conda create --no-default-packages --name elpis_v2 python=3.13.2 r-essentials r-base=4.3.1 postgresql=17.4
```

You can also create an environment from a predefined `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

## üìÑ Creating and Using a Spec File

Conda can generate a **spec file** containing an exact list of package versions and build strings, making your environment fully reproducible.

### üîß Create a Spec File

```bash
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Create Environment from Spec File

```bash
conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt
```

### üì¶ Install Packages from Spec File into Existing Environment

```bash
conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Activating and Managing Environments

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Activate an Environment

Once created, activate your environment:

```bash
conda activate elpis_v2
```

### ‚ùå Deactivate and Delete Environment

When you no longer need the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate 
conda remove -n ENV_NAME --all
```

---

#  Step 2: Logging the Environment

Documenting your environment is critical for collaboration and reproducibility.

## üì§ Export Environment to YAML

To export all dependencies (including pip-installed packages) to a human-readable YAML file:

```bash
conda env export > environment_setup.yml
```

This file can be shared to recreate the environment using `conda env create -f environment_setup.yml`.

## üîç Export an Explicit Spec File

For a byte-for-byte identical reproduction, use:

```bash
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

This includes build info and channels but is not human-readable.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Keep both `environment.yml` and `spec-file.txt` under version control (e.g., in Git).
- Use `environment.yml` for collaboration and readability.
- Use `spec-file.txt` for precise replication on the same system.
- Regularly export and update these files as your environment evolves.

Maintainable environments save time and frustration‚Äîinvest in managing them well. üí°

---

# Step 3: Managing Packages in Conda Environments

Managing packages is a crucial step in maintaining a clean and efficient conda environment. This guide walks you through listing, searching, installing, and updating packages using `conda`, `conda-forge`, and `pip`.

---

## üì¶ Listing Installed Packages

To view all packages installed in a specific environment (e.g., `myenv`):

```bash
conda list -n myenv
```

If you're already inside an activated environment, simply use:

```bash
conda list
```

---

## üîç Searching for Packages

To search for a package available in the conda repositories (e.g., `scipy`):

```bash
conda search scipy
```

---

## üì• Installing Packages with Conda

To install one or more packages into an environment:

```bash
conda install --name myenv scipy curl=7.26.0
```

If you omit the `--name myenv` part, the packages will be installed in the **currently active environment**.

---

## üåç Using Conda-Forge and Pip

### üß™ When to Use Conda-Forge or Pip

- Prefer `conda` for compatibility and environment management.
- Use `conda-forge` if a package is not found in the default conda channels.
- Use `pip` only if the package is unavailable through conda or conda-forge.

### üîó Adding Conda-Forge Channel

To add `conda-forge` and set it as the highest priority channel:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

From this point, `conda install <package>` will also search conda-forge.

---

### üêç Installing Pip and Pip Packages

First, install `pip` if it‚Äôs not already available:

```bash
conda install pip
```

Then install the required pip package:

```bash
pip install see
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Mixing conda and pip packages can lead to dependency issues. Always prefer conda when available.

---

## üìÇ Updating `environment.yml` and Spec File

It‚Äôs good practice to keep your environment configuration files up to date after installing new packages. Update as follows:

### `environment.yml` (manual update required):

```bash
conda env export --name myenv > environment.yml
```

### Spec File (machine-readable):

```bash
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

Use these files to recreate environments reliably.

# Step 4: Managing Environment Variables in Conda

Environment variables are a critical aspect of many data science and software projects. They allow you to securely and flexibly manage sensitive credentials such as API keys, access tokens, usernames, passwords, and database configuration values‚Äîwithout hardcoding them into your codebase.

In this project, environment variables are especially important due to the need for managing multiple secure credentials and configuration settings. Fortunately, Conda provides built-in tools to manage these variables directly within your environment.

---

## üîç Viewing Environment Variables

To see which environment variables are currently defined for your active Conda environment, run:

```bash
conda env config vars list
```

---

## ‚ûï Setting Environment Variables

To define a new environment variable (e.g., `MY_VAR`) with a specific value:

```bash
conda env config vars set MY_VAR=value
```

You can add multiple variables at once by separating them with spaces:

```bash
conda env config vars set DB_USER=myuser DB_PASS=mypassword API_KEY=xyz123
```

---

## üîÅ Reactivating the Environment

After setting or changing environment variables, you must **reactivate your Conda environment** for the changes to take effect:

```bash
conda activate your-env-name
```

Replace `your-env-name` with the actual name of your environment (e.g., `elpis_v2`, `test-env`, etc.).

---

## ‚úÖ Verifying Environment Variables

To confirm that an environment variable is properly set, you can either:

1. Use the `echo` command:

```bash
echo $MY_VAR        # On Linux/macOS
echo %MY_VAR%       # On Windows
```

2. Or re-run the Conda command to list environment variables:

```bash
conda env config vars list
```

---

## üßº Unsetting Environment Variables

If you need to remove a variable from the environment:

```bash
conda env config vars unset MY_VAR
```

Again, you‚Äôll need to reactivate your environment after making changes:

```bash
conda activate your-env-name
```
